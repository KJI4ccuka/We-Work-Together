                            God promised Abraham a land and a nation when he made a covenant with him in Genesis 15. As
                            believers in Jesus and the Messiah, we know that God promised his people a land and a nation
                            forever. As believers in Jesus, we know when a promise is made in covenant between God and
                            his people, God will never go back on that promise. Today we know that Israel is the land of
                            God’s chosen people because of his covenant with Abraham. As Christians we can be sure that
                            God’s promises to us today will be fulfilled in the same way. Because of this, Israel has a
                            right to their land, a right to be a nation, a right to be a people group, and a right to
                            defend themselves.

                <p>
                    In Genesis 12, God promised Abraham that he would “bless those who bless you and curse those who
                    curse
                    you.” Throughout history, we have seen the proof that God blessed those nations who stood with
                    Israel
                    and cursed those who did not. Even today, this means we will be blessed as individuals, and as a
                    nation
                    when we stand by the people of Israel. We can stand with Israel knowing that God has a purpose and a
                    plan for his people.

                    Today in most Middle Eastern countries, any person who is found to be following Jesus is killed,
                    persecuted or imprisoned. Since the beginning of the nation of Israel, Christians have been welcomed
                    and protected in the borders of Israel. In addition, it is the only country in the Middle East who
                    values the rights of women, refugees, religions and the press. It reflects these rights in its
                    politics and ways of conducting daily life. We can support the nation of Israel just because they
                    protect the rights of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East.

                        Israelis live life by the mandate Tikkun Olam, or “Save the World”. This is the belief that if they
                        make the world a better place for one person, they have done good in the world. God made his chosen
                        people Israel to be a “light to the nations,” and we can see this in the way Israel blesses the rest
                        of the world.

                            In his letter to the Romans, Paul recounts his time with the churches of Macedonia. They
                            lavishly poured out a love offering for the ‘poor saints’ in Jerusalem. It was such a
                            substantial gift that Paul decided to deliver it personally to Jerusalem. But why did they
                            give so much? Paul explains: “For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make a
                            certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem. It pleased them
                            indeed, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their
                            spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in material things.” (Romans
                            15:26-27)
                            The believers of Macedonia understood an important principle. Salvation came to the Gentile
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            world through Israel, and they were obligated to return a gift of thanks. We, too, need to
                            remember that Jesus was Jewish, the authors of the Bible were all Israelites, and everything
                            that defines our faith today – even the sacrifice of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy
                            Spirit – took place in Israel through Jews. Thus, Jesus himself declared: “Salvation is of
                            the Jews!” (John 4:22) Have you ever shown your gratefulness to God’s people for the way He
                            used them to administer to us the means of His eternal grace? If not, I encourage you to
                            follow the Macedonian example and express your appreciation to Israel.
